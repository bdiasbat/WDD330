    <h2>Object Method: This</h2>
    <p>"To access the object, a method can use the this keyword."</p><br><br>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <p>Object: "a self-contained set of related values and functions"<br>
        "One way to think about an object is that itâ€™s like a dictionary where you look up a property name and see a
        value."<br>
        "JavaScript objects are similar to a hash or associative array in other programming languages"</p><br><br>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <p>The document object method (DOM): <br> DOM treats all items in a HTML document as a node. It allows us to get elements from the HTML document, use it in
        a function, and write the result into the HTML document.</p><br><br>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <p>Events: <br> " Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an
        event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to." <br> By adding a .EventListener you can make the page more interactive and responsive. </p>
