    <h1>Week 07 Readings</h1><br><br>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2><br>
    <p>Further Functions</p>
    <p>"The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have properties and methods themselves."<br>
        the call() method can be used to set <i>this</i> to a value in a function to a given object.</p>
    <p>Custom Properties allows you to add your own properties for example <i>description</i></p>
    <p>"AnImmediately Invoked Function Expression– or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the
        name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of
        the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function)."</p>
    <p>Temporary variables are useful to avoid confusion in the code when you need a variable for a short period of
        time. For that we use <i>temp</i></p>
    <p>"Curryingis a process that involves the partial application of functions. It’s named after the logicianHaskell
        Curry— not the spicy food — just like the programming language Haskell is. His work on a paper by Moses
        Schönfinkel lead to the development of this programming technique."<br>
        "Currying allows you to turn a single function into a series of functions instead. This is useful if you find
        that you’re frequently calling a function with the same argument."</p><br><br>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2><br>
    <p>Ajax</p>
    <p>"The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the
        resource you wish to fetch."<br>
        Ajax allows the webpage to only reload specific parts of it, so you do not lose actions taken in a different
        section of the webpage.</p>
    <p>"headers – A Headers object (see later section) containing any headers associated with the response
        url – A string containing the URL of response
        redirected – A boolean value that specifies if the response is the result of a redirect
        type – A string value of 'basic', 'cors', 'error' or 'opaque'. A value of 'basic' is used for a response from
        the same domain. A value of 'cors' means the data was received from a valid cross-origin request from a
        different domain. A value of 'opaque' is used for a response received from 'no-cors' request from another
        domain, which means access to the data will be severely restricted. A value of 'error' is used when a network
        error occurs."</p>
